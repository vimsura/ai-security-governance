# AI Authorization Model

## Overview
As AI systems move toward autonomous decision-making,
clear authorization boundaries become critical.

This framework defines how AI systems should be
authorized, controlled, and stopped.

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Explicit Identity
Every AI system or agent must have a unique identity.
No anonymous execution.

### 2. Least Privilege
AI agents must operate with the minimum permissions
required to perform approved tasks.

### 3. Scoped Authority
AI actions must be limited by:
- Scope
- Time
- Context
- Environment

### 4. Human Override
A human override mechanism must exist for:
- Emergency stop
- Privilege revocation
- Model shutdown

---

## Governance Controls

- Identity registration for AI agents
- Policy-based authorization
- Approval workflows for elevated actions
- Continuous monitoring and logging

---

## Outcome
This model ensures AI remains:
✔ Accountable  
✔ Auditable  
✔ Controllable
